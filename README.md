### Notes

* Classes should have the first letter as a capital
* anything that starts with `__` is called a "magic method"
* you can assign value to parm by given a default value `def __init__(self, name, price, qty=0):`
* to force a data type use `:` after varible name example `def __init__(self, name: str, price: float, qty=0):`
    * fact that we have assigned a default value of an int in `qty` tells python the date type it must use
* assert keyword check what is happening to your expectations
* asserts allow you to add better error handling easily
* Class attributes are shared belongs to the class itself
* instance attribute are only for the instance of that class
* `__dict__` all the attribute for Class level and instance level. This is useful for debugging
